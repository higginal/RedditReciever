# RedditReciever
reddit reciever project
Author: Avery Higgins

For this assignment, I set up a Node.js api that accepts the operation 'GET', and returns the title of the top post of
my favorite subreddit, GifRecipes. By calling:
      
      http://localhost:8000/redditer/:search
      
The user will recieve a response including the 'search' parameter as the title of the response, and the title of the
top post of GifRecipes. 

For this assignment, I used MongoDB, Express, and Snoowrap to access setup the database, run the server, and to grab the
information from the reddit website.
